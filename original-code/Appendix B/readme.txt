To compile the code in the source folders requires Emscripten 1.38.45 (the latest version at the time of this book's writing).

The instructions for installing Emscripten can be found in Appendix A of the book.


In order to install Emscripten, Python 2.7 is required. Conveniently, Python also has the ability to run a local web server. You will need to use a local web server to run many of the examples included. 

Instructions for how to run Python's local web server can also be found in Appendix A.


Python doesn't need to be used if you don't want to use it but you will need to make sure that the web server you use has the 'application/wasm' Media Type set for '.wasm' files.
